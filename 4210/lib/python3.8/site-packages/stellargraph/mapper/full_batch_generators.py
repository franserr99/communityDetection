    argument.

    For these algorithms the adjacency matrix requires preprocessing and the

    each algorithm. The options are as follows:

    *   ``method='gcn'``: Normalizes the adjacency matrix for the GCN algorithm.
        This implements the linearized convolution of Eq. 8 in [1].
    *   ``method='sgc'``: This replicates the k-th order smoothed adjacency matrix
        to implement the Simplified Graph Convolutions of Eq. 8 in [2].
    *   ``method='self_loops'`` or ``method='gat'``: Simply sets the diagonal elements
        of the adjacency matrix to one, effectively adding self-loops to the graph. This is
        used by the GAT algorithm of [3].
    *   ``method='ppnp'``: Calculates the personalized page rank matrix of Eq. 2 in [4].
