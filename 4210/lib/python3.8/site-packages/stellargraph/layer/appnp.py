    Implementation of Approximate Personalized Propagation of Neural Predictions (APPNP)
    as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05997.

    The model minimally requires specification of the fully connected layer sizes as a list of int
    corresponding to the feature dimensions for each hidden layer,
    activation functions for each hidden layers, and a generator object.

    To use this class as a Keras model, the features and preprocessed adjacency matrix
    should be supplied using:

    - the :class:`.FullBatchNodeGenerator` class for node inference
    - the :class:`.ClusterNodeGenerator` class for scalable/inductive node inference using the Cluster-GCN training procedure (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07953)
    - the :class:`.FullBatchLinkGenerator` class for link inference

    To have the appropriate preprocessing the generator object should be instantiated
    with the `method='gcn'` argument.

    Example:
        Building an APPNP node model::

            generator = FullBatchNodeGenerator(G, method="gcn")
            ppnp = APPNP(
                layer_sizes=[64, 64, 1],
                activations=['relu', 'relu', 'relu'],
                generator=generator,
                dropout=0.5
            )
            x_in, x_out = ppnp.in_out_tensors()

    Notes:
      - The inputs are tensors with a batch dimension of 1. These are provided by the \
        :class:`.FullBatchNodeGenerator` object.

      - This assumes that the normalized Laplacian matrix is provided as input to
        Keras methods. When using the :class:`.FullBatchNodeGenerator` specify the
        ``method='gcn'`` argument to do this preprocessing.

      - The nodes provided to the :meth:`.FullBatchNodeGenerator.flow` method are
        used by the final layer to select the predictions for those nodes in order.
        However, the intermediate layers before the final layer order the nodes
        in the same way as the adjacency matrix.

      - The size of the final fully connected layer must be equal to the number of classes to predict.
